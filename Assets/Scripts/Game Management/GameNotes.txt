Fix bear event
	Have the "Retreat" method make them run forward instead of backwards, and put a skinny box collider going straight
		out of the front of the bear cave. 

Put big colliders on the paths to trigger events, and one on the top of the mountain end goal area. 

Draw little icons for the instructions, or get them. 
	Need WASD/Arrow Keys, LMB, RMB, Mouse wheel, and space. 

Bonus Events:
	Have caves be good or bad, depending on whether or not there's a bear inside. 
	Waterfalls for good
	Beehives for bad
	Seeing wolves for good? or bad?
