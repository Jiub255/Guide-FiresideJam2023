TODO:

Have non-bear caves too.
	Look the same as bear caves, but you can go in and get points instead of getting chased and losing points. 

Put big colliders on the paths to trigger events, and one on the top of the mountain end goal area. 

Draw little icons for the instructions, or get them. 
	Need WASD/Arrow Keys, LMB, RMB, Mouse wheel, and space. 

Bonus Events:
	Have caves be good or bad, depending on whether or not there's a bear inside. 
	Waterfalls for good
	Beehives for bad
	Seeing wolves for good? or bad?
