TODO:

Put big colliders on the paths to trigger events, and one on the top of the mountain end goal area. 

Have camera follow the mountain guide by default, but if you move the camera manually, it stops following the guide until
	you push space to recenter on the guide. 

Draw little icons for the instructions, or get them. 
	Need WASD/Arrow Keys, LMB, RMB, Mouse wheel, and space.
